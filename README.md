# ESP-IDF-ThingSpeak-MQTT   

## Description    
In this project, an ``ESP32`` is used to publish data (humidity and temperature) from a ``BME280`` sensor to ``ThingSpeak`` using the ``MQTT`` protocol. An HTTP equivalent of this project can be found in one of my repos (https://github.com/MUDAL/ESP-IDF-ThingSpeak-HTTP). Both projects have the same objective, the only difference is the communication protocol used.    

## Requirements    
1. ESP32 Dev Board  
2. BME280 sensor  
3. ThingSpeak account  
4. Visual Studio Code  

## MQTT protocol
